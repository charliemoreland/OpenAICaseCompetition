# OpenAICaseCompetition
25th Annual Ivy College of Business Internal Case Competition.
I competed against 9 other teams in a 24 hours Business Strategy Case competition.
The topic was OpenAI's future business Strategy, my team focused on increasing computing power through reinvestment into MS Azure with current OpenAI partner Microsoft.
Along with increased computing power, our team developed a Strategic Business Plan to shift focus away from Direct-to-consumer ChatGPT model and focus on B2B adoption through OpenAI's API model and Cloud Platform Integration.
Focusing on increasing revenue through the API's pay per token pricing model. 
Here are a few of the major slides:
